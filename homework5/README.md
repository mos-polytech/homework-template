# TODO CLI App


## Legend

This application is used for our internal needs.
It was developed a long time ago by an unknown developer.

It works fine. But there are several things we would like to improve.


## Running

To run this app follow these steps:

1. `cd homework5`
2. `python3 -m todo` ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m))
3. Enjoy!
